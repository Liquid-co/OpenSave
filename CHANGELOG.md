All notable changes to OpenSave are documented here. This project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [2.0.0] — 2026-07-07

Complete rewrite of OpenSave from Node.js/Electron to **Go + Wails**: one small
native binary with no runtime to install. Wire-compatible with the original —
Go and JS devices sync together (same REST routes, P2P protocol, UDP discovery,
and relay envelope).

### Added

- Native desktop app (Wails webview) with a Hydra-style dark UI; system-tray
  background running.
- Auto-scan for Steam, emulator, repack, Epic, GOG, and Unreal saves, shown as
  a browsable grid of vertical Steam cover art.
- Block-level delta sync (SHA-256, adaptive 64 KB–2 MB blocks) — only changed
  blocks transfer.
- Snapshot history with per-branch timelines, whole-save and single-file
  restore, and an automatic safety snapshot before every restore.
- Lineage-based conflict resolution (keep local / remote / both-as-branch).
- P2P over LAN (zero-config UDP discovery) and internet (relay room codes),
  with an option to self-host the relay.
- Cloud backup to Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, WebDAV, webhook, or a
  local/NAS folder, with a per-game cloud snapshot browser.
- In-app About dialog and an optional "update available" banner.
- First-run welcome with guided next steps.

### Fixed

- Cross-origin (CORS) preflight is handled, so tracking games from the UI no
  longer fails with "Failed to fetch".
- Cloud sync self-heals a revoked/expired OAuth token instead of falsely
  showing "connected", and prompts you to reconnect.
- Cover-art image error handling no longer risks a UI freeze; the sidebar,
  cards, and detail header fall back cleanly.
- Per-game view state no longer leaks between games in the detail view.

### Security / safety

- Local and single-file restores now confirm before overwriting the current
  save (the current state is snapshotted first).
- The local API and dashboard remain loopback-only; relay traffic is limited
  to paired peers.
